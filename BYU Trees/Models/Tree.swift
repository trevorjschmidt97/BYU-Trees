The bark and twigs of the Jeffrey Pine are pleasantly aromatic.<br/><br/><B>Pruning Recommendations:</B> Eliminate any double leaders early and prune for deadwood.  Prune for clearance as necessary. <br/><br/>For general pruning techniques, click <A HREF=\"http://www.na.fs.fed.us/Spfo/pubs/howtos/ht_prune/prun001.htm\" TARGET=\"_blank\">here.</A><br/><br/><B>Fertilizer Requirements: </B>For general fertilizer recommendations, click <A HREF=\"http://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/factsheet/HG-510.pdf\" TARGET=\"_blank\">here</A> (organic), or <A HREF=\"http://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/publication/HG_509.pdf\" TARGET=\"_blank\">here</A> (inorganic). <br/><br/><B>Water Management: </B>For general water management recommendations, click <A HREF=\"http://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/publication/HG-523.pdf\" TARGET=\"_blank\">here</A>.<br/><br/><B>Installation/Establishment Techniques: </B>Usually planted as a balled and burlapped tree.
